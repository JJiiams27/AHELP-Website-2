# AHELP-Website-2

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with Tailwind CSS for rapid development.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` – start a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.
- `npm run build` – build the site to the `dist/` directory.

Assets such as Chart.js and the Inter font are bundled locally via NPM, removing external CDN dependencies.
